## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Babylon.js Game Engine seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@babylon-game-engine.com**

Include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** within 48 hours
2. **Provide an initial assessment** within 5 business days
3. **Work with you** to understand and validate the issue
4. **Develop and test a fix** (timeline depends on complexity)
5. **Release the fix** and publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Measures

### Frontend Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented to prevent XSS attacks
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Production deployments should use HTTPS
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers are configured in production builds

### Backend Security

- **Input Sanitization**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests
- **File Upload Security**: Restricted file types and size limits
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages

### Code Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed for security vulnerabilities
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Following OWASP guidelines
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are kept up to date

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Development Environment

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive data to version control
   - Use `.env` files for configuration
   - Keep `.env` files out of version control

3. **Validate All Inputs**
   - Sanitize user inputs in the playground editor
   - Validate file uploads and asset names
   - Check code before execution

### Production Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS**
   - Always deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
   - Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
   - Use secure cookies

2. **Configure Security Headers**
   ```nginx
   add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
   add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
   add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
   add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade" always;
   add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;
   ```

3. **Secure File Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Set proper file permissions
   chmod 644 *.js *.css *.html
   chmod 755 directories/
   chmod 600 .env
   ```

4. **Regular Backups**
   - Backup saved assets regularly
   - Test backup restoration procedures
   - Store backups securely

### Network Security

1. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Only expose necessary ports (80, 443)
   - Block direct access to API ports from external networks
   - Use reverse proxy for API access

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
   - Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
   - Set up alerts for potential attacks

## Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Risk**: Malicious code injection through the playground editor

**Mitigation**:
- Input sanitization in Monaco editor
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Output encoding for dynamic content

### Code Injection

**Risk**: Arbitrary code execution through saved assets

**Mitigation**:
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Input validation for asset content
- Restricted API access

### File Upload Vulnerabilities

**Risk**: Malicious file uploads through asset system

**Mitigation**:
- File type validation
- Size limits enforcement
- Secure file storage location
- Virus scanning (recommended for production)

### API Security

**Risk**: Unauthorized access to API endpoints

**Mitigation**:
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Authentication (for future versions)

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security-related environment variables
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=js,ts,json
```

### Nginx Security Configuration

```nginx
# Security headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data: blob:; connect-src 'self' ws: wss:;" always;

# Hide server information
server_tokens off;

# Prevent access to sensitive files
location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
    access_log off;
    log_not_found off;
}

location ~ ~$ {
    deny all;
    access_log off;
    log_not_found off;
}
```

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**
